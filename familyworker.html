      <h4>Church and Family Worker</h4>
      <p>
        We are pleased to announce our new Church and Family Worker is Mark Harrison, who many people will know already from his involvement with Exalt, Grimoldby Breakfast Church or Lighthouse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mark was born near Leicester but has been in Lincolnshire for 31 years. He has been married to Margaret for 40 years and has 3 wonderful children who are all settled locally with their families. He first received an accolade for his poetry aged 12 years old and still lists poetry as a hobby alongside

      <p>
        Philately

      <p>
        Prayer

      <p>
        Psalms
      </p>
      <p>
        and Puddings !
      </p>
      <p>
        He has previously served as National Secretary for the Association of Methodist Scout & Guide Leaders which should stand him in good stead for making closer links with our uniformed organisations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current situation is making it difficult for Mark to hit the ground running but he has a wealth of ideas, so watch this space for events and activities to support him with.
